# P2 - algorithms

A collection of data structures and algorithms I'm currently learning about.

Also I think I'll put my experimental implementation of an ecs architecture here as well.

Some of them are in use by my game engine `NeonWood`

Use at your own risk

TODO:

* New Data Structures:
  * binary trees
  * persistent trees
  * small vectors
  * small map
  * name map
  * segmented list

* Perf tests:
  * sparse set
  * ring queue
